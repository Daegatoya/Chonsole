# Chonsole
My first Chat project ever. UNDER TESTING.

## How does it work?

Simple and easy : You enter a message in your console, the backend program send it to a web server through a websocket, the web page send back the message and the backend program displays it on your screen!

## Information

This program is local. This means it is not usable outside a network, as it doesn't use a multi-thread technology. It is solenly for learning purposes and nothing else.
